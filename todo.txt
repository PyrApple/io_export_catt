rename addon to "io_mesh_catt"


- add orientation check for source/receiver animation sampling

- check what's the min requirement for a src.loc to be valid in catt (only pos or aimpos required as well?)

- fix room export, broken in blender 4.0+

- suggest to use interpolation mode "linear" for receiver and source position export based on animations

- create a global round_factor variable
- create a global linebreak symbol
- create a global tabulation symbol (for src.loc export)


factorize material creation method (used twice, during import and during create new catt material)
